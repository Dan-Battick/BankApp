# BankApp
Basic banking application
Instructions:

We need to create a basic banking application that allows persons to open accounts, deposit, withdraw and query the transactions done on an account.
	
- Should allow users to create customers
- A customer can open multiple accounts.	
- An account should be a savings or checking account.
- Deposit and withdrawals are considered transactions and most be recorded.
- Querying an account should show the current balance and the last 10 transactions. 

The application should be done with a console application as it's GUI. You should still use Dependency injection where possible.

Tasks:	
1 - Design and implement the application described above.
2 - Host the source code on github and commit to it often.
